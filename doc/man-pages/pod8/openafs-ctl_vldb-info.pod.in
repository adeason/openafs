=head1 OUTPUT

Database information is output as one piece of information per line, in the form:

   field: value

At a minimum, the following fields are shown:

=over 4

=item B<type>

The type of the underlying ubik database. Currently, this is always C<flat>, to
indicate a database consisting of a single flat file.

=item B<engine>

The ubik storage engine implementing the database. Currently, this is always
C<udisk>.

=item B<version>

The current version of the database on disk, represented by an epoch and
counter. For example the version C<1234.5> has an epoch of C<1234> and a
counter of C<5>.

=item B<size>

The approximate size of the database. The actual size of the database file on
disk may be different, due to ubik metadata and other data not considered part
of the database itself.
